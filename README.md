# KenKen
My Version of [KenKen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen) made in MATLAB. It's more customizable than any other version I have seen. In the 'Generation' tab, you can change the size of the grid, the size of the blobs, which operations are allowed, and the numbers used in the grid. It also has a few convenience tools to make filling in the puzzle easier.

Left click to enter numbers, right click to enter notes.

The popup used for entering numbers was inspired by an app named "Latkin" that is no longer available on the Apple Appstore.
